				<em>
					Taurus â€“ the Wandering Bull Being the one who betrayed their best friend, 
					goddess Hera herself, this is an unfortunate being that has to wander the Earth in order 
					to find freedom. As if something was always poking them behind their back, reminding them 
					of happiness that once was, stinging and pushing forwards, they close up in their own worlds, 
					lonely and separated from their core. To find love, a Taurus has to travel the world, change 
					perspective or make a shift in their entire belief system and their system of values.
